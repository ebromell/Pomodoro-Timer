# Pomodoro Timer App


"The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. For this project, you will implement a simplified version of Cirillo's original Pomodoro technique."

This project is designed to test my ability to work with React.
```
Installing packages via NPM
Running tests from the command line
Writing React function components
Using hooks
Debugging React code
```
This project checks for 

```
Use of any non-pure functions
Use of any variable or function names that can be improved.
Use of if statement to bound lower and upper limits of the focus or break duration. 
Use of if statements in the returned JSX. 
Use of components with multiple responsibilities or multiple reasons to re-render. 
Lots of conditional logic embedded in the useInterval() hook.
Logic should be broken out into small, single-responsibility pure functions that mutate the state as necessary.
